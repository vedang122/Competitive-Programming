x+y = x&y + (x|y) = (x^y) + 2*(x&y) (very imp property whenever sum of two number in bits there is a relation. )

x|y = (x^y) + (x&y)

If x1|x2|...xn = A 
then A|xi=A (also A can't have msb position more than any of xi's)

Note bitwise OR and & in general doesn't follow subproblem substructure, so dp is not possible.
