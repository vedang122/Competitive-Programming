Theory - Extended Eucledian algorithm --- 

Let a, b be two numbers g=gcd(a,b) and a*x and b*y are two multiples of a and b respectively such that a*x!=b*y (or a*x itself is not a mulitple of g=gcd(a,b)) then  minimum difference between min(a*x-b*y) over all mulitples is >=g.

Or in other words 

for k=0,g,2*g,3*g..
solution of this equuation exists otherwise it's not. 

a*x-b*y = k 

For example -  solution for this quation exists always-
(a/g)*x-(b/g)*y=1
